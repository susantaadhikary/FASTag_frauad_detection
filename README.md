# FASTag_frauad_detection


Project summary
This dataset is a fastag dataset. From this dataset we will predict the fraud dectection. First we clean our dataset then we apply EDA-1 of our dataset to visualize our data. We check fraud indicator and visualize it.After using data preprocessing then we apply EDA-2 for real time prediction.Then we implement our model and calculate accuracy score,F1-score,roc-auc score.At last we use feature selection which was the most important parameter of our dataset
